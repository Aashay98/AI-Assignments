## Assignment 2
You’ll exercise the map coloring problem through the Missouri County graph
that is shared in Figure 1. You are allowed to use the colors: Red, Green, Blue,
White, Black, Magenta, Cyan, and Orange. No adjacent states will be in the
same color. You can start from any county that you prefer and keep going until all of the counties
have been colored.

## Assignment 3
Adversarial Maze is a two-player game played on a grid. Each player controls a character, and
the goal of the game is to reach the other player’s side of the grid. However, the players cannot
move through walls.
On each turn, a player can move their character one square in any direction, as long as the
square is not occupied by a wall or the other player’s character. If a player moves their
character onto the same square as the other player’s character, they capture the other player’s
character. The captured character is then removed from the game and the capturer wins
automatically.

The first player to reach the other player’s side of the grid wins the game.
Implement an adversarial search algorithm to play Adversarial Maze. Your program should
be able to play against a notable opponent, and it should be able to win as often as possible.
Please remember the minimax algorithm, and then try to implement that.
